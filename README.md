This is mainly a for using Grayjay in the browser but I added catppuchin css because I am currently using this theme.

1) make sure you have [Grayjay-desktop](https://grayjay.app/desktop/) installed
2) open grayjay via this [script](https://github.com/F-4Dev/.dot-files/raw/refs/heads/main/scripts/open-grayjay.sh)
   **(make sure to change the path in this script to your grayjay installation)**
4) install [stlyus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) extension and create a style for urls matching this regex: `http://localhost:.*/web/.*`
6) paste in the [css](https://github.com/F-4Dev/grayjay-catppuchin/raw/refs/heads/main/style.css)

   done ^^


no one will use this but i am doing this instead of studing ( ._.)
