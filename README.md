This is mainly a for using Grayjay in the browser but I added catppuchin css because I am currently using this theme.

## How to use

1) make sure you have [Grayjay-desktop](https://grayjay.app/desktop/) installed
2) open grayjay via this [script](https://github.com/F-4Dev/.dot-files/raw/refs/heads/main/scripts/open-grayjay.sh)
   * **make sure to change the path in this script to your grayjay installation**
   * **chnage the script to use your prefered browser (I am using librewolf)**
4) install [stlyus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) extension and create a style for urls matching this regex: `http://localhost:.*/web/.*`
6) paste in the [css](https://github.com/F-4Dev/grayjay-catppuchin/raw/refs/heads/main/style.css)

   done ^^

## Chanages made to the UX
* removed the top subscriptions because they're already visible on the sidebar and  there's more space for videos
* made subcription groups smaller
* removed home page on side-bar because no one needs it
* removed new window button because it doesn't while inside the browser
* made mini-player bigger
* change postion of player while reading comments to the right
* made recomended videos scrollable while in player-screen
